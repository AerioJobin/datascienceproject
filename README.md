# House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features like the size of the house, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. The model is built using Python and a Linear Regression algorithm. This repository demonstrates the complete data science workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Build a machine learning model to predict house prices.
- **Dataset**: A CSV file containing various features of houses such as size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and price.
- **Model**: Linear Regression.

## Key Features of the Project

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and ensures data quality.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Adds a new feature, `price_per_sqft`, and handles categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performs visualizations such as correlation matrix, price distribution, and scatter plots.
4. **Machine Learning Model**: A Linear Regression model is trained and evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-Squared.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Compares actual and predicted prices visually.

## Directory Structure

```
├── house_prices.csv         # Dataset used for the project
├── house_price_prediction.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook for the project
├── README.md                # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt         # Dependencies
```

## Requirements

The project is written in Python. To run the code, you need to install the following dependencies. You can do this by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook (`house_price_prediction.ipynb`) to see the workflow step-by-step.

4. Make sure you have the dataset (`house_prices.csv`) in the same directory or specify the correct path when loading the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs EDA to uncover relationships between different features. Some of the visualizations include:

- **Correlation Matrix**: Displays the relationship between features.
- **Price Distribution**: Shows the distribution of house prices.
- **Size vs. Price Plot**: Visualizes the relationship between house size and price.

## Machine Learning Model

We use a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices. The model is evaluated using:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
- **R-Squared**: Explains how well the model fits the data.

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced Models**: Explore more advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate more domain-specific features or handle outliers more effectively.
